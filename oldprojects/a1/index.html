				<p>A video game developer is a software developer that specializes in <span class="special">video game</span> development â€“ the process and related disciplines of creating video games. A game developer can range from one person who undertakes all tasks to a large business with employee responsibilities split between individual disciplines, such as programming, design, art, testing, etc. Most game developer companies have video game publisher financial and usually marketing support. Self-funded developers are known as independent or indie developers and usually make indie games.</p>

                

				<p>A developer may specialize in a certain video game console (such as <span class="special">Nintendo's Wii U</span>, <span class="special">Microsoft's Xbox One</span>, <span class="special">Sony's PlayStation4</span>), or may develop for a number of systems (including personal computers). Video-game developers specialize in certain types of games (such as role-playing video games or first-person shooters). Some focus on porting games from one system to another, or translating games from one language to another. Less commonly, some do other kinds of software-development work in addition to games.</p>
